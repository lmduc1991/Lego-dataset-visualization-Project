LEGO DATASET VISUALIZATION PROJECT

	Goal of this project: use PowerBI to visualize dataset from LEGO company from beginning to 2019

	Lego dataset: sets.csv and themes.csv. Data were collected to late 2020. In order to have clean full year data, project only focus on data to 2019.

	Skills using in this portfolio project:
		- Use Power Query in PowerBI to clean data (duplication, empty row and data out of time range, etc)
		- Use PowerBI for visualization (create relationship between 2 files before visualization)

	Visualization of this dataset is aiming to answer these questions below:
		- How many sets and themes LEGO have since it started up to 2020
		- What is the biggest sets with how many parts?
		- Number of Sets per Themes
		- Number of Sets per year LEGO produces over time
		- Number of Themes changed over time
